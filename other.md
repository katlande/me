		<p>Don't see what you're looking for anywhere else? If you need a bioinformatician for something, I can probably do it. Whether that involves developing custom software or pipelines, creating webtools for high-profile publications, or even just some basic consulting for groups looking to dip their toes into omics analysis but don't know where to start. <a href="mailto:kathryn.lande@mail.mcgill.ca">Please reach out</a> for a free consultation about what's possible!</p>
