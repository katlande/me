			<h2>Service Rates</h2>
		</header>
		<p>At this time, I accept contracts paid in both USD and CAD, and have right to work status in both the United States and Canada.</p>
		<p>Service rates vary from contract to contract based on project complexity and the entity requesting services. I offer both fixed-rate contracts for individual projects, and hourly rate contracts for more flexible needs. Currently, I offer the discounts for the following:</p>
  <ol type="A">
  <li>Academic or non-profit researchers</li>
  <li>Non-US entities </li>
  <li>Projects that do not require external server time (simple analyses of pre-processed data, teaching contracts, or entities who can offer their own compute resources)</li>
</ol>
