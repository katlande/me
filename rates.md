			<h2>Service Rates.</h2>
		</header>
		<p>At this time, I accept contracts paid in both USD and CAD, and have right to work status in both the United States and Canada.</p>
		<p>Service rates vary from contract to contract based on project complexity and the entity requesting services. I offer both fixed-rate contracts for individual projects, and hourly rate contracts for more flexible needs. Currently, I offer the following discounts:
		- Academic or non-profit researchers
		- Non-US entities 
		- Projects that do not require external server time (simple analyses of pre-processed data, teaching contracts, or entities who can offer their own compute resources) </p>
