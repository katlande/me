		<p>Many students are thrust into bioinformatics projects with little experience or oversight. It's easy for novice bioinformaticians to make small mistakes that have massive downstream effects on a group's research, whether that means pursuing data artifacts for years, or later finding out that a published analysis was based on a hidden error. A great way to avoid this problem is by empowering students early in their careers with some hands on mentorship from an expert. I have pre-made tutorials for the following topics, but am also happy to create new lessons tailored to a specific group's interests:</p>
  <ol type="A">
  <li>Basics of Statistical Analysis for Biology</li>
  <li>RNAseq Analysis in R</li>
  <li>Whole Genome/Exome Sequencing Crash Course</li>
</ol>
<p>Generally speaking, teaching contracts involve 1-3 lessons with your student(s), as well as a set number of hours of access to mentorship via zoom calls and email questions.</p>
